									<p> Kitchen Konnect would like to promote a positive urban environment in Trinidad and Tobago by easing the cognitive load of its citizens.  Cognitive load refers to the total amount of mental effort being used in the working memory. This website aims to allow local registered groceries to be able to receive order requests from their customers and be able to notify them when their order has been prepared and ready for pickup.            
									</p>
									<br/>
									<p>
									This website works in collaboration with the mobile application for Kitchen Konnect. The mobile application has a plethora of functions that help to ease the cognitive load of customers.  It allows customers to view the contents within their refrigerator or pantry from a remote location through a live stream. Customers can then log their grocery list in the grocery reminder list tool on the application.       
									</p>
									<br/>
									<p>
									After logging their grocery list, customers can then set a reminder for a particular date and time or/and a geo reminder when passing the groceryâ€™s brick and mortar store. This would alert them that they have to make a grocery stop when best convenient for them. Customers also have the option of sending their selected grocery a request to prepare their grocery list. This is all done from the mobile application.  
									</p>
									<br/>
									<p>
									When customers send their grocery list to their desired grocery, the grocery can access these requests through this website. Here, the grocery can view their requests and have a medium of alerting the customer when their order is ready for pickup. This alert is done through a push notification on their mobile devices. This application aims to make the interactions between local groceries and customers more convenient for both parties.
